Unless you put your fingers in their face, though, these big birds don’t (necessarily) have a taste for blood: they crack open high-calorie plant protein sources like nuts and seeds.

  "informational_blurb.zawa.tree_frog": "Small, tropical or subtropical arboreal frogs. Fast moving, timid and sometimes hard to spot. All species need water to reproduce and lay eggs, and generally live in humid environments. All species are very vulnerable to pollution and disease, thanks to thin, water and air-absorbing skin.",
  "informational_blurb.zawa.tree_frog_0": "Though this American tree frog represents the Amazon rainforest in advertising materials and low-quality themed dining experiences, it’s actually native to Central America. This iconic frog lays eggs on the underside of leaves hanging above water, and if threatened by predators, its tadpoles can hatch early to escape.",
  "informational_blurb.zawa.tree_frog_1": "This brightly-colored amphibian is actually a species of toad, with arboreal habits similar to tree frogs. Panamanian golden frogs may still live in the foggy cloud forests, but many scientists think they may be completely extinct in the wild. They are one of many victims of the rapidly spreading chytridiomycosis, which affects amphibians around the world.",
  "informational_blurb.zawa.tree_frog_2": "Unlike many animals in the encyclopedia, the Cuban tree frog isn’t threatened with extinction: in fact, it’s one of the offenders! These unassuming brown frogs are invasive in parts of North and South America, including biodiversity hotspots like Hawaii. They outcompete and even eat native species of frogs.",
  "informational_blurb.zawa.tree_frog_3": "An alternate name for this frog is the funny “pantsless frog,” because their markings don’t extend all the way to their thighs on some color morphs. Funny name aside, clown frogs are incredibly adaptable in their reproduction habits, and can change spawning locations based on temperature, water conditions, and predators in their habitat.",
  "informational_blurb.zawa.tree_frog_4": "This rocky-looking tree frog can survive some rocky conditions: living in the Northeastern US and Canada, they’ve adapted to weather the cold winters. Gray’s tree frogs can survive their body fluids being frozen to 18 degrees (-8c) without their tissues being damaged.",
  "informational_blurb.zawa.tree_frog_5": "Also called dumpy frogs, these mint-colored frogs are popular pets thanks to their laid-back personality and long lifespan. Unfortunately, images of cute, fat frogs on social media are often the product of overfeeding. White’s tree frogs have unique antibacterial compounds in their skin, which leaves them unusually unaffected by chytridiomycosis.",
  "informational_blurb.zawa.tree_frog_6": "Mean-spirited scientists also call this frog the “bug eyed tree frog,” which is a little bit rude: their eyes aren’t that bugged, are they? If its specialized camouflage doesn’t keep it safe, the mossy tree frog will curl up into a ball and play dead if found by a predator. Unfortunately, this doesn’t deter humans, and they are threatened by pet industry poaching.",
  "informational_blurb.zawa.tree_frog_7": "This amazing amphibian sure earns its name, with bright emerald green skin and striking tiger stripes on its side. At night, it roams the humid lowland forests of Columbia and Panama looking for insect prey. Though rare, it does not face any particular conservation threats, but chytridiomycosis and deforestation need to be considered.",
  "informational_blurb.zawa.tree_frog_8": "Lots of animals use textured skin, muted colors or even color changing to camouflage, but glass frogs take passive predator avoidance to another level: their translucent bodies allow them to blend right in wherever they go. These freaky frogs’ organs can even be seen through their skin.",
  "informational_blurb.zawa.tree_frog_9": "Beginner herpetologists can confuse this splendid specimen and the similarly sized White’s tree frog, but magnificent tree frogs are slightly bigger, are darker colored, and have a yellow belly instead of white. Magnificent tree frogs also have white or yellow spots on their backs and legs.",
  "informational_blurb.zawa.tree_frog_10": "Like many other tree frog species, pacific tree frogs reproduce by amplexus. In the breeding season, male frogs will clamp onto a female to try and guarantee that he can fertilize her eggs. Some males are super dedicated, and will hang on for days - and some aren’t picky, and will lock onto things that aren’t even a female frog!",
  "informational_blurb.zawa.tree_frog_11": "Foam nest tree frogs live in volatile conditions, which can quickly get far too dry and hot for their eggs to survive. Female frogs lay their eggs on trees, then multiple males will fertilize them and cover them in a wet “foam” to help them retain moisture. While this might seem scandalous to humans, the more males join in, the more likely the eggs are to hatch safely.",
  "informational_blurb.zawa.tree_frog_12": "The pretty, pastel blue-green color is creamy and calming, but it’s not why Amazon milk frogs earned their name. When threatened, they release a thick white fluid from their skin. While they aren’t deadly poisonous like some other frogs and toads, it’s definitely unpleasant, and might be enough to convince predators that they’re cutting lactose out of their diet.",
